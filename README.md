# CloudORHS

Based on Sparkfun project to control clouds through openweather and Blynk, I am recreating project for my Database and SQL class. The code on the sparkfun git repo was a little bit confusing for me to understand so I decided to rewrite the code!

Teachers: Modify the code to read the weather data from your city and have students work in groups to think about how they might simulate a different weather pattern using the LED's (What does sunny, raining, hail, windy, snowy look like?)
